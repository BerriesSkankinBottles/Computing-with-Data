# PowerShell - Introduction

PowerShell is a command-line shell that provides a richer feature set for power
users. Thanks to built-in support for the .NET Framework, PowerShell can be
a more appealing shell to .NET developers when compared to Command Prompt.

__Note:__ PowerShell examples in the book ran on Windows; the code on this
website runs on Linux â€” the output may vary.
