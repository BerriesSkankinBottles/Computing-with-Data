# PowerShell - Variables

Sometimes piping isn't enough; we need variables to store, manipulate, and read
data. Variables in PowerShell are objects; variable names have to start with
a `$` as the examples below demonestrate:

@[]({"project": "ps1", "stubs": ["chapter3/powershell-variables.ps1"], "command": "pwsh chapter3/powershell-variables.ps1"})
