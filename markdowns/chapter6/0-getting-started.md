# Getting Started

The Python programs in this book target Python 3.5.1 (the latest version
available at the time of writing). Python 2.x is legacy and Python 3.x offers
several new features but it's not entirely backward-compatible. The code
examples in this chapter should run as expected using either version (unless
otherwise stated). The code segment below demonstrates a short Python program:

```python runnable
# This is a comment
print("hello world")
```
