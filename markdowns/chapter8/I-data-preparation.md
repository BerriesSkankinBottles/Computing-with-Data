# Data Preparation

We emphasize in this book graphing data by first creating a dataframe with
the appropriate data and informative column names; this approach is better than
keeping the data in arrays. To create a dataframe, use the `data.frame`
function, for example:

@[]({"project": "R", "stubs": ["chapter8/data-preparation.R"], "command": "./run-with-tikz-viewer chapter8/data-preparation.R"})
